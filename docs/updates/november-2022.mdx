# Foundations Course - November 2022 Update

This update brings the course up to date with Riverpod 2.1 and includes a brand new section about Riverpod 2.x & the Riverpod Generator package.

All starter projects and code snapshots have been updated to the latest packages, starting from section 4.

## CHANGELOG

### Section 4

Lesson 04.03:

- Updated starter project, now using Riverpod 2.1
- Updated `main.dart` to use new Flutter 3.3 error handling code based on `PlatformDispatcher` (see [Handling errors in Flutter](https://docs.flutter.dev/testing/errors))

### Section 5

Lesson 05.08:

- `AsyncValue.error` now takes a non-optional `StackTrace` as second argument
- Mention the new `AsyncNotifier` class as a replacement for `StateNotifier` (added in Riverpod 2.0)
- `AsyncNotifier` will be covered in the upcoming section 13

Lesson 05.10:

- Updated condition for showing an alert dialog to `!state.isLoading && state.hasError`. Previously, it was `!state.isRefreshing && state.hasError`

Lesson 05.13:

- Updated `AsyncValueUI` exception to check for `!isLoading && hasError`, not `!isRefreshing && hasError`

### Section 6

Updated code snapshots, no other changes.

### Section 7

Updated code snapshots, no other changes.

### Section 8

Lesson 08.05:

- Updated to show how to initialize Sembast with the new code in `main.dart` (error handling code is now based on `PlatformDispatcher`)

Lesson 08.11:
